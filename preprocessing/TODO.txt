Create a mega script that:
1. Splits the conn.log.labeled in a number of files based on the increment value in seconds (time window)
2. Based on the number of created files it creates directories and copies the split conn logs and the ssl.log.labeled inside
3. Runs the feature extractor in each of the directories
4. Concatenates the feature.csv files after removing the header (this can be done in python / pandas too).
